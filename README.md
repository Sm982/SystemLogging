# SystemLogging
System Logging is a short program created to log all related system noftications to a text document. This program creates a text document with todays date in short format with long format for the year, opens the text document and adds logs of your own choice.

## How to use this program.
Simply open up the code and copy what you need to into your own program and fit it for use. I generally would probably make it so all necessary things get put into the system log text file. Make sure to also copy the timeFile.h file into your project and include it as well.

## What is included?
* SystemLogging.sln
* SystemLogging/SystemLogging.cpp
* SystemLogging/SystemLogging.vcxproj
* SystemLogging/SystemLogging.vcxproj.filters
* SystemLogging/timeFile.h

## Am I allowed to use this program/function in my own project free to use?
Yes. My teacher and I both created this project from c++'s own documents, as this is public information and the code is easy to program I am therefore allowing it for public use.

This project has also been released under the Creative Commons licence, as this is just a simple part of the function/program.
